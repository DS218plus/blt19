# Welcome to Berlin Legal Tech Hackathon 2019!

This is the central repository for all technical materials you'll need to get organized and kickstart your hackathon weekend.

## Step 1: Brainstorm, Pitch and find a Team

## Step 2: Register your Team and Idea as an issue in this repository

Once you have found a team and decided on what you want to build, file your team as an "issue" here in this repository.
